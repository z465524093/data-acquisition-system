## Data Acquisition System
We propose a real-time data acquisition system for multiple parts of human body based on wearable devices, which integrates real-time, accuracy and portability. The system has a friendly and concise interface, which can be used to monitor, collect, display and store data from multiple sensors. The wearable device is a strap and vest integrated with multiple inertial sensors, featuring good real-time performance, high precision and wearable portability. The system can obtain the acceleration, angular acceleration and angle information of multiple parts of the human body, which can be used as a training data set in the field of action recognition, and can be applied to medical health, sports and fitness industries
